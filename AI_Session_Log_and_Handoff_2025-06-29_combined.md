# AI Session Log & Handoff — 2025-06-29

### 2. Log of Everything Done
- **Environment Setup**
  - Child‑theme stack confirmed (`functions.php`, `style.css`, `brandon-custom‑scripts.js`) with GSAP 3.13, P5.js 1.9.4, CustomEase, SplitText, ScrollTrigger, ScrambleTextPlugin.
- **ScrollTrigger & Pinned Sections**
  - Discovered Semplice pins hero sections with its own ScrollTrigger; redirected custom triggers to `body` to decouple timing.
- **P5.js Canvas Fix**
  - Refactored P5 sketches to compute container dimensions in `setup()` and `windowResized()`, restoring full‑width backgrounds.
- **SVG Arrow Re‑design**
  - Final 90° arrow built with path `M5 12 L18 12 M12 5 L18 12 L12 19`; orientation via `rotate()`, tail length editable via first `M` x‑coord.
- **Block‑Scramble Text Effect**
  - Workflow simplified: `.js-block-scramble` class auto‑injects required markup; Sweep → Reveal → Glitch sequence implemented with ScrambleTextPlugin.
  - Scroll‑trigger fires 200 px from viewport bottom; SPA clean‑up on `sempliceTransitionInDone`.
- **Timing & Randomisation**
  - Sweep 0.8 s → pause 0.2 s → reveal 0.6 s.
  - Glitches every 4–8 s with 15 % burst chance; custom ease `0.86,0,0.07,1`.
- **Code Quality**
  - Version bumping added for cache bust; extensive debug logging behind `BRANDON_DEBUG_MODE`.
- **Partial Coverage Bug Identified**
  - `querySelector` only targeted first span; multi‑line text missing sweep animation.
- **Workflow Docs Updated**
  - Lessons appended to central onboarding read‑me; unnecessary Code‑module step removed.

### 3. Combined Learnings
1. **Targeting Semplice Text** – Use `querySelectorAll('span[class*="font_"]')` to cover every styled line; build either per‑span overlays or a container overlay.
2. **ScrambleText Beats SplitText for Block Effects** – ScrambleText with block Unicode yields the desired CodePen look without heavy DOM manipulation.
3. **Pinned‑Section Interference** – Any element inside a Semplice‑pinned section should treat `body` (or other non‑pinned ancestor) as its ScrollTrigger trigger object.
4. **P5.js in SPA Contexts** – Always size canvases at creation time and destroy them on page change to avoid orphaned instances.
5. **User‑Friendly Authoring** – Empower the designer by mapping effects to simple CSS classes rather than manual HTML or code‑module injection.

### 4. Outstanding (Low‑Priority) Items
- **Multi‑Line Sweep Strategy** – Decide between per‑span sweeps vs single container sweep; then implement.
- **P5.js Background Regression** – Background dots sometimes fail on first load; intermittent, not blocking.
- **Glitch Timing Fine‑Tune** – Reduce initial glitch delay to 1–2.5 s if aesthetics require.
- **Visual Polish for Block‑Scramble** – Current effect still below CodePen fidelity; may require per‑char SplitText enhancement.
